We present a theoretical study of the optical spin injection, optical current
injection, and second harmonic generation of two 50\% hydrogenated graphene
structures: Cwc{16}wc{8}himBHalt and Cwc{16}wc{8}himBHup. Optical spin injection,
under the incidence of circularly polarized light onto nonmagnetic
semiconductors, creates spin-polarized electrons in the conduction bands.
Optical current injection and second-harmonic generation are nonlinear second-
order effects that are allowed in materials without inversion symmetry. The
results are calculated in a full electronic band structure scheme within DFT in
the LDA approximation. Our results show an anisotropic behavior in the optical
responses of the spin, the current injection and second harmonic generation. We
obtained maximum absolute magnitudes of the degree of spin polarization of 61\%
and 64\% for the \emph{alt} and \emph{up} structures, respectively, and it is
also possible to optically generate an injection current coming mainly from the
carbon layer on both \emph{alt} and \emph{up} systems. Besides, we found that
both structures are excellent candidates for second harmonic generation.
